# Command-Line Scientific Calculator

This is a Python-based command-line scientific calculator that can perform basic and advanced mathematical operations. 
It is designed to handle multiple values for certain operations and uses Python's built-in `math` library for accurate calculations.

## Features

- **Addition**: Add multiple values.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract multiple values from the first number.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply multiple values.
- **Division**: Divide the first number by each subsequent value.
- **Exponentiation**: Raise the first number to the power of each subsequent value.
- **Square Root**: Calculate the square root of a single number.
- **Trigonometric Functions**:
  - **Sine**: Find the sine of an angle (in degrees).
  - **Cosine**: Find the cosine of an angle (in degrees).
  - **Tangent**: Find the tangent of an angle (in degrees).

## Usage

Run the program from the command line and select an operation by entering its corresponding number. 
Enter numbers separated by spaces as prompted. The calculator then outputs the result.

## Requirements

- Python 3.0 and later
- `math` library (comes pre-installed with Python)
